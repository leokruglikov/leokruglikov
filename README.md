### Hello there 👋
## About me: 
My name is Leo, I am a Physics major from EPFL, Switzerland. A programming enthousiast, I am captivated with the idea of solving almost any science problem with programming. Obsessed with the idea that ~~almost~~ all world problems can be simulated on a computer. 
Apart being a Physics major, I am a self-taught programmer and yet pursuing my own computer science way. I always want to learn both new ways to solve problems and new, high performance programming features.
