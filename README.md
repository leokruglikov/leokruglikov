# About me: 
My name is Leo, I am a first year bachelor's student in physics at Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL). I love science, especially applied science. I like to combine it with programming using different numerical methods for creating simulations. I always want to learn both new ways to solve problems and new programming features.
